# Control Flow

Control flow consists of choices and loops. This flow allows for conditionals and
iterative actions on objects.

There are two types of control flows:

- Choices
    - `if` statements
    - `switch()` calls
- Loops

## 5.2 Choices
Typically if-else statements are contained within brackets in R.  

`if` always returns some value for assignment.

If no `else` statement is added, `if` returns a `NULL`.
