# Vectors
Vectors are sequence objects. There are two main different flavors of vectors: atomic vectors
and lists. Atomic vectors all have the elements of the same type. Lists don't necessarily
have elements of the same type.

# Atomic Vectors
There are four types of atomic vectors: 
- Logical (bool + na); can be written as TRUE or FALSE or abbreviated T or F
- Integer
- Double
- Character

Although these might be considered as scalars in other languages, they are all vectors
with lengths of 1.

# Long vectors with c()
C is short for combine and can be used to create vectors with lengths greater than 1.

e.g.,
`x <- c(1, 2, 3)`

# Determine the type of a vector
Determine the type of a vector using `typeof()`

Determine the length of a vector using `length()`

# Missing values
R represents missing values as `NA`. `NA` tends to be infectious except in the 
context of some logical statements.

Check to see if a vector has missing values using:
`is.na(x)`
