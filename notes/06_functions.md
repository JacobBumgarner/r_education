# Functions

## 6.2 
Functions are objects.

Functions have three components:

- Arguments
- Body
- Environment

### 6.2.1 Function components
The `formals()` of a function are the arguments.

The `body()` of a function is the code inside the function, not including comments

### 6.2.2 Primitive functions
Some functions are written in C code.

E.g., `sum`, or `[`

### 6.2.3 First-class functions
There is no special syntax for defining functions in R. You bind them to variables as
with other objects.

### 6.2.4 Invoking functions

## 6.3 Function composition
