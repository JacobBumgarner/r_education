# Overview
In order to improve my understanding of RShiny outside of a safe tutorial environment,
I wanted to build my own app to visualize some interesting data.

As such, this app was constructed to visualize the locations of expert resource centers
with the capacity to treat and manage two diseases:
- Diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis (dcSSc)
- Polymyositis

For context, these are two very rare diseases that are relevant to a bioinformatics project
that I am working on.

# App information
This app will be used to visualize four pieces of information.

1. The prevalance of these diseases in the general population
2. Sex differences in the prevalence of these diseases
3. A map of the geographic distribution of the expert resource centers capable.
4. A bargraph showing count of expert resource centers per country.
